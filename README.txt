The software model for the COE3DQ4 project (image decompression) includes the involves files:

Coding.h
Compare.c
Decoder.c
Encoder.c
Parse_bmp.c
Project.c

The C code has been compiled in both Windows (using Borland 5.5) and Linux (using gcc 3.2.3). The code will
likely compile on other operating systems and/or with other compilers, however minor changes may be needed.

The following files may be useful:

compile_borland.bat (a batch file to compile with borland, simply double-click it or run it from the command prompt)
makefile (the makefile for gcc, simply enter "make" at the command prompt without the quotes)
